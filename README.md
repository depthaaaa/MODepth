# MODepth: Mixed Features and Orthogonal Representations for
Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation



# Upcoming releases

- [x] release code for evaluating in KITTI

- [ ] model release KITTI, Cityscapes

## Inference

```bash
python test_simple.py
```



## ðŸ’¾ Pretrained weights and evaluation

You can download weights for some pretrained models here:

* [KITTI MR (640x192)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IfveSOMBLO1lv7hsaCe_fxMTXG4wsxsL/view?usp=sharing)
* [KITTI HR (1024x320)]()
* [CityScapes (512x192)]()

To evaluate a model on KITTI, run:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<your_desired_GPU> \
python -m manydepth.evaluate_depth \
    --data_path <your_KITTI_path> \
    --load_weights_folder <your_model_path>
    --eval_mono
```

Make sure you have first run `export_gt_depth.py` to extract ground truth files.
